After clicking "Begin Import", you should see a loader during the import. After import, a results section should appear, which summarized the number of imported items.

### 2. Configure the channel
With the content now imported, the next step is to do the initial configuraiton of the channel. This will allow the website to connect to the content and render it.

- Navigate to "Settings" (cog icon on the left-hand side) - and then go to "Manage Websites" under "Config"
- Click on "Create website" to create a new channel definition
- Fill out the form as follows:


| Field | Instruction |
| - | - |
| Name | The name for the channel, use "Mosey Bank" or a name you've selected yourself
| URL | Copy the URL from your browser and remove everything after the domain. So `https://example.cms.optimizely.com/ui/EPIServer.Cms.UI/...` becomes `https://example.cms.optimizely.com/` |
| Start page | Select the start page of the channel, that is "Mosey Bank" for the included content pack |
| Use site-specific assets | Checking this option will allow you to store assets at a channel level. |

### 3. Configure the languages
The last step is to have the available languages match the languages in the content pack.
